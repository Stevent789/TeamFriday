  <li>Once upon a time</li>
  <li>In a Grand Circus far far away</li>
  <li>there were three brave knights, er, coders. </li>
  <li>Armed with their computers,</li>
  <li>They bravely fought their way through Week 1 of the Front-End Bootcamp</li>
  <li>But they made it to the weekened.</li>
  <li>It was a much-needed break from their intensive adventures.<li>
  <li>If only they were aware of the true trials and tribulations slowly approaching them. Dun. Dun! DUNNNN!!!
  <li>In the coming weeks they would have to train harder than they ever had before. </li>
  <li>Few have made it this far, but somehow they knew they would be successful in the end</li>
